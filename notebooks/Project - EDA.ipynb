Some felt spooked by the tragic history of the site. They didn’t reckon on rats.\\n\\nBut one month after decamping from their old HQ off Times Square, the glamorous crews of titles like Vogue and Vanity Fair are waging a daily battle against a positive rat rampage. All employees have been banned from eating at their desks for fear of dispensing inadvertent treats to the roaming rodents.\\n\\nSources have told the Daily News that Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who likes a world of red carpets and sparkle not droppings and thick tails vanishing into cracks, has refused to show up in her office until the problem is bought under control.\\n\\nWhile rat sightings are common in New York City’s ageing subway system, few would have imagined their invading a building as brand new and prestigious as One World Trade. But there they are, it seems, in ever multiplying numbers, happily scaling what is now the tallest building in the Western hemisphere.\\n\\n\"A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor\\'s office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,\" one company source told the Daily News. \"They ate through his rug to fit under his door.\" Another disgusted staff member told the paper that the rats at Vogue had essentially “taken over”.\\n\\nIt’s not quite the start that Graydon Carter, Editor-in-Chief, had imagined either. Ambushed by a Daily News reporter outside the tower he was asked whether the rats were a disgusting as everyone has been saying. “They’re rats,” he replied. “What do you think?”',\n",
       " 'Though Apple was mum about battery life for its forthcoming wrist-worn accessory when it was announced on Tuesday, the company has since said that it expects people to charge it nightly, suggesting the battery life will offer about one day of operation.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,\" Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris said in a statement to Re/code. \"We anticipate that people will charge nightly, which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.\"\\n\\nBut sources who spoke with John Paczkowski went further, and indicated that the company isn\\'t happy with the current uptime of the Apple Watch. One person said the watch\\'s battery life is currently \"about a day,\" and that the company is working on modifications ahead of its launch to improve it.\\n\\nA one-day battery life is about on par with other touchscreen smart watches currently available on the market, including devices running the competing Android Wear platform.\\n\\nThe uptime stands in contrast to less powerful smart watches, like the Pebble, which utilizes a monochrome black-and-white display and lacks a touchscreen. Pebble\\'s low-power screen is always on and provides up to a week of use before the wrist-borne device needs to be recharged.\\n\\nBattery life for the Apple Watch remains somewhat up in the air because the product isn\\'t yet finalized and ready for launch. Apple revealed on Tuesday that the wearable device will launch at some time in early 2015, but declined to offer a more specific window.\\n\\nThe company was also vague on other aspects of the hardware, including pricing. While the Apple Watch will start at $349, a breakdown of how much various models will cost was not given.\\n\\nWhile the Apple Watch will start at $349, it\\'s possible that the high-end models could reach into a five-figure price point. The luxury Apple Watch Edition is made of hardened 18-karat gold, and existing 18-karat gold watches typically sell for more than $10,000.',\n",

       " 'Small-time drug offenders in New York City could soon find themselves on the receiving end of a ticket instead of inside a jail cell if a policy change on low-level marijuana possession is adopted this week. The move would overwhelmingly affect black and Latino residents, who represented 86 percent of marijuana possession arrests in the city this year, according to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project.\\n\\nAdvocates of criminal justice reform applaud the proposal as a step toward softening the long-term consequences of having a minor drug offense on one’s record, but there is a chance that the policy, which New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to announce Monday, could boomerang. The strategy would require anyone caught with a small amount of marijuana – likely to be defined as 25 grams or less – to be issued a court summons instead of being handcuffed, arrested and fingerprinted. But doing so means those summonses would not be subject to prosecutorial review, which would identify if a summons was justified in the first place, legal experts say.\\n\\nUnder the current system, when an arrest is made, the charge becomes a court case reviewed by a prosecutor. A prosecutor could throw out the charge or refuse to prosecute should he or she see any indication that the arresting officer violated due process, such as searching a person’s backpack without probable cause. Prosecutorial reviews “perform a screening function to weed out legally insufficient cases,” Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law at Columbia Law School in New York, told International Business Times. Under the new policy, “that function has now been eclipsed,” he said.\\n\\nThat sentiment was echoed by Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson, who announced earlier this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana violations. The Brooklyn DA’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases that involved arrest out of 2,526 such cases since July, according to the New York Times. Allowing police officers to write tickets without accountability creates “a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place,” Thompson told the Times. “These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.”\\n\\nAnother possible repercussion of the city’s proposed policy change could be that arrest warrants are later issued for people who miss their court dates, adding possibly thousands of cases to the docket. Some 28,000 people were arrested on minor marijuana charges in 2013; issuing arrest warrants for all the people who fall sick or cannot miss work on the day of their summonses would put more stress on an already overburdened system. “It’s not solving the problem that they’re trying to solve,” Fagan said.\\n\\nAs many states, counties and cities across the country have done at various times over the past several decades, New York decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana in 1977. The law made possession of the drug a ticketable offense and applied to marijuana that was out of public view and was not being smoked. Nevertheless, police have continued to arrest people and charge them with misdemeanors after finding small amounts of marijuana in their pockets or belongings. \"At this point, [not arresting people for weed] wouldn\\'t be progressive; it\\'d be catching up with the mainstream,\" Gabriel Sayegh, the New York state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, told Vice.',\n",
       " 'A newly surfaced audio recording allegedly captures the exact moment that unarmed teen Michael Brown was shot and killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.\\n\\nAccording to an attorney for an unidentified man who lives in an apartment building near the site of the shooting, the recording captures as many as 11 shots fired in the Aug. 9 incident.\\n\\nThe audio, which was played on CNN Monday night, could not immediately be verified by The Washington Post. But a burst of gunfire can be heard (six shots), followed by a pause, and then several more shots (at least four).\\n\\n“He was in his apartment, he was talking to a friend on a video chat, he heard loud noises and at the moment — at the time he didn’t realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,” the man’s lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said in an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon. “It just happened to capture 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.”\\n\\nAccording to Blumenthal, FBI agents came to her office on Monday to interview the man about the recording.\\n\\nThe 12 second-audio clip is the only using a cell-phone app that only records short excerpts of a video conversation. It captured nothing before the shots began and nothing after. The man, who would like to remain anonymous, has asked that the accompanying video not be shown, Blumenthal said in an interview with The Post.\\n\\nShe first learned of the audio clip through the man’s roommate, who is a former client, and she urged him to share it with authorities.\\n\\n“He was there when the event happened,” Blumenthal said, adding that he initially assumed the noise was fireworks not gunshots. “He is a very private person and he his not seeking publicity of any kind whatsoever. He was even unaware that this tape was relevant to anyone.”\\n\\nNeither Ferguson nor St. Louis County police have contacted the man or Blumenthal about the video. After interviewing him on Monday, she said the FBI indicated that they planned to speak with him again on Tuesday.\\n\\nAutopsy reports conducted by St. Louis County and by the Brown family found that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head.\\n\\n[This post has been updated.]\\n\\nRELATED READING:\\n\\nCNN corrals unconfirmed Ferguson audio scoop: The backstory from Erik Wemple',\n",

       " 'What\\'s thought to be an audio recording of the shooting death of Michael Brown has reportedly surfaced. According to CNN, an unidentified man, who has since been interviewed by the FBI, is said to have managed to record the incident in which Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson earlier this month, setting off a national firestorm. \\nThe most notable tidbit from the short recording (and what will become subject to the most immediately scrutiny and parsing) is the existence of two distinct volleys of gunfire from Officer Darren Wilson\\'s weapon. From CNN:\\n\\nclass=\"cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph3\">In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.\\n\\nForensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.\\n\\nThe man who recorded the shooting was talking to someone on video chat when the sounds of gunfire erupted in the background. The Daily Mail added:\\n\\nLopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear \\'point of contemplation\\' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.\"\\nAlso of some serious importance, should the tape\\'s authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson.',\n",
       " 'Robots are increasingly replacing humans in a variety of mundane tasks, like bolting a car together or making lollipops, but now they are moving into the security business.\\n\\nMicrosoft recently installed a fleet of 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots to protect its Silicon Valley campus. The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings. There’s also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry. It can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if they’re stolen.\\n\\nThe K5 robots come from a California company called Knightscope, which calls the robots “autonomous data machines” that provide a “commanding but friendly presence.” Sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say.\\n\\nLet’s be honest though, the robots look pretty damn cool. They’re like modern versions of R2-D2.\\n\\nThankfully—or sadly, depending on how you look at it—the K5 robots don’t have any weapons on them. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene. There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s new protectors are fairly autonomous.

       " 'Nigeria says it has struck a cease-fire deal with Boko Haram, raising hopes that over 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped by the militant group will be released. But mystery continues to surround the identity of the interlocutor on the other side of the negotiations.\\n\\nNigerian officials said the deal was reached in Chad on Friday in talks with a Saudi Arabia-based Boko Haram representative named Danladi Ahmadu.\\n\\nThe name took many by surprise, including people who have been involved in previous negotiations with Boko Haram. “I have failed to find anyone who has ever heard of him,” BBC’s Nigeria correspondent wrote.   “We\\'ve tried verifying the authenticity of the person from sources traditionally close to Boko Haram militants and we are getting negative feedback,” the editors of Nigerian news site Sahara Reporters told The WorldPost by email.\\n\\nAhmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who is considered close to Boko Haram\\'s leaders, said he does not believe Ahmadu is part of the group’s leadership or that he speaks for the group. “I challenge Danladi Ahmadu to an open debate if he has d [sic] interest of Nigeria at heart. Who is he?\" Salkida wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nBut Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government\\'s spokesperson on the Boko Haram insurgency, told The WorldPost Saturday that the government is confident it has been negotiating with the right guy.\\n\\n“These talks did not just happen one sunny morning ... They approached the president of Chad, and if he wasn’t confident [of Ahmadu’s identity] he wouldn’t have connected him with the president of Nigeria,” Omeri said. \"The fact that this contact comes from Nigeria’s neighbor gives us confidence.\"\\n\\nChad has confirmed it is acting as a mediator in the talks to free the girls, who were kidnapped in the Nigerian village of Chibok in April. Since Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan visited Chad last month, rumors have grown that Nigeria\\'s government was quietly negotiating the girls\\' release via its neighbor. It was not immediately clear how long the talks have been taking place.\\n\\nBoko Haram\\'s leadership has not commented on the cease-fire. Meanwhile, Ahmadu himself has purportedly made at least two statements in recent days. On Friday, he gave an interview with Voice of America’s Hausa-language service in which he didn’t mention the kidnapped schoolgirls and was vague on the details of the cease-fire, Agence France-Presse reported. The news agency also noted that Ahmadu referred to the militant group as Boko Haram, a name used by outsiders but not by the insurgents themselves.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Sahara Reporters said its correspondent in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri had obtained a CD recording of another statement by Ahamdu. This time, he was more precise.\\n\\n“On the girls that we took from Chibok, all that we want before we free the girls is to get justice from the Nigerian state because there are many of our members that their business premises were destroyed, some killed and others in detention and many other oppression,” Ahmadu said, according to a translation from Hausa by Sahara Reporters. The news site’s editors said they remain skeptical about his identity.\\n\\nAs part of the deal, Omeri said, the talks taking place in Chad this week will address the release of the schoolgirls.\\n\\nOmeri added that the militants are motivated by a wish to reintegrate into society. “They are working towards peace in order to have a chance for them to return to normal things -- for example, many have businesses, \" he said.\\n\\nAsked whether Nigeria would consider releasing captured Boko Haram militants in exchange for the girls, Omeri said “every asset\" will be directed towards the girls\\' release. \"Everything possible is being done until the day they are freed,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Boko Haram want peace, they are ready for it and intend to have it implemented,\" he added.\\n\\nAfter the cease-fire was announced, suspected Boko Haram militants continued to attack communities in northeast Nigeria, leaving several dozen dead over the weekend.\\n\\nBut Omeri insisted that the violence would not deter the negotiations. He suggested that militants in remote areas may not have heard about the cease-fire, or that the attacks could have been perpetrated by criminal opportunists, rather than Boko Haram members.\\n\\nBoko Haram is \"deeply fractured,\" according to the risk consultancy Stratfor, quoted in Reuters Sunday. Nigeria\\'s government had a \"difficult time identifying a Boko Haram representative who could make compromises and guarantee the entire group will observe them,\" Stratfor said.\\n\\n\"It is quite possible that Abuja has reached an agreement with a legitimate representative of a specific cell ... that holds the kidnapped schoolgirls captive,\" the group added.\\n\\nIn the kidnapped girls’ hometown, the community hardly dared to hope that the girls might be finally returned. \"We don\\'t know how true it is until we prove it,\" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok Local Government Area, told The Associated Press.',\n",

Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, it’s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesn’t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.\\n\\n#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having ″record shattering snowfall” this winter. Lord Jesus.\\n\\n4. “Male birth control” will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a “male birth control” injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the world’s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that it’s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration — and neither of those things are true. “The news came from a press release — and call for donations! — by the foundation behind Vasalgel,” Julia Belluz explained at Vox, “highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.” Bottom line: It’s great that someone’s working on male birth control, but it’s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.\\n\\n5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that “ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.” The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of “updates” on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People “saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,” one dispatcher said. “It’s all rumor, it’s all hearsay.”\\n\\nPossible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything??\\n\\n6. Shakira is not dead. The singer’s hips don’t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained “exclusive images and details” from the scene. Colombia’s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, she’s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.\\n\\n7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved children’s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show “Peppa Pig” go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character — and also “haram,” or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax — but a hoax for a cause. “This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,” he wrote. “It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.”\\n\\n8. Obama will not “resign amid new Benghazi revelations.” Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the president’s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, it’s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the “joke”!\\n\\nIf Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!\\n\\n(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)\\n\\n9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, let’s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?\\n\\n10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report — besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook — is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. “I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,” one commenter wrote. “30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation … That’s just incredible!” Indeed.\\n\\nDid we miss any other notable fake stuff this week?

Apple Watch will also stop delivering notifications when the battery reaches 10% or lower in an effort to conserve the remaining power.\"Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked.

I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.\\n\\n'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely!\\n\\n'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself?

They always made sure that no one would come into the house.\\n\\n'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'\\n\\nAnother said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'\\n\\nPublically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.\\n\\nDaily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it.\\n\\nIt is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.\\n\\nCredido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.\\n\\nRecords filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.\\n\\nHer birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biography\\n\\nDaily Mail.com has attempted to speak with the couple but they have declined to return any calls.\",\n",

       " 'Militants reportedly have three captured jets and witnesses cited as saying they have seen planes flying low over Aleppo\\n\\nIslamic State (Isis) is takings its first steps towards building an air force by training pilots to fly captured fighter planes, according to a group monitoring the conflict in Syria.\\n\\nIsis is using lots of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and Jeeps taken from the Syrian and Iraqi armies but this is the first report that it has planes in the air.\\n\\nIsis, which took the US by surprise this year with its rapid territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq, has three Russian-built MiG jets, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which appears to have a good network of observers on the ground and has often proved reliable in the past.\\n\\nRami Abdulrahman, who runs the British-based group, said Isis has trainers who had gained experience in the Iraqi air force under former president Saddam Hussein.\\n\\nAbdulrahman cited witnesses who had seen the planes flying low over Aleppo, in rebel-held northern Syria.\\n\\nIf Isis was able to train pilots, they could mount 9/11-style suicide attacks on key installations in Damascus or Baghdad.\\n\\nDefence analysts said that while this is feasible, they were extremely sceptical. “There is a small chance but not a big chance,” said Afzal Ashraf, a former RAF captain, counter-terrorism specialist and consultant at the London-based Royal United Services Institute(Rusi).\\n\\nIt was feasible to train pilots for small aircraft but it would be a struggle to do the same with an advanced fighter jet. Such jets would require frequent maintenance as well as a good navigation system and air traffic control, Ashraf said.\\n\\nSuch planes could be easily picked off by US, UK, Turkish or even Syrian planes or air defences. The UK is flying reconnaissance and bombing missions only over Iraq while the US is engaged in both Iraq and Syria.\\n\\nIn February last year, the SOHR reported the capture of the al-Jarrah military airport near Aleppo, which had been held by Assad’s forces. The MiG fighters were said to have been taken at the time.\\n\\nThe monitoring group reported witnesses saying the planes flying low over Aleppo recently appeared to be MiG 21s or MiG 23s and had taken off from and returned to the nearby al-Jarrah base. It added that training courses are taking place at the base.\\n\\nThe SOHR said it did not know whether the planes were armed with missiles.\\n\\nIsis has taken swathes of Sunni-dominated territory in Iraq and is on the outskirts of Baghdad.\\n\\nRaffaello Pantucci, a counter-terrorist specialist at Rusi, said he had seen footage of captured planes and questioned their viability. “They were covered in bird shit,” he said.\\n\\nPantucci said they would pose no problem for the sophisticated air defence capabilities of the US and its Nato ally Turkey, and even to a lesser extent those of Syria’s President Bashar-al-Assad.\\n\\nAshraf said of the former Iraqi air force pilots reported to have joined Isis that it would be hard for them to keep up with the latest advances. “Flying is a very perishable skill,” he said.\\n\\nHe predicted they were almost certain to crash. “You have to be able to fly and to take off and to navigate. If you do not know what you are doing, you are likely to stall it,” Ashraf said.']"

Missing since Nov. 22, 2012, Foley appears to be forced to read an anti-American statement before he is beheaded in the gruesome five-minute clip.\n",

      "Titled “A Message to America,” the gruesome clip shows a masked militant saw away at the neck of James Wright Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native captured in Binesh, Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012.\n",

For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” Foley reads as he kneels beside an armed militant, masked and dressed all in black. “My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity, and don’t accept some minor compensation for my death from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with their recent aerial campaign in Iraq. I call on my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force: Think about what you are doing. Think about the lives you destroy, including those of your own family … I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,” Obama said in the clip.\n",

      "Lebanese officials said the woman, Saja al-Dulaimi, is believed to be the wife of the reclusive IS leader. She was held by Syrian authorities and freed in a prisoner exchange with the Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaida branch, earlier this year.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It was unclear what would have brought the woman and child to Lebanon, where IS controls no territory and enjoys only small support in some predominantly Sunni Muslim areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, Ibrahim told The Associated Press that al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi national who traveled to Syria before arriving in Lebanon, is not al-Baghdadi's wife. He identified her as the sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi, who is being held in Iraq as a terror suspect.\n",

      "WOBURN, Mass. (AP) — A 113-year-old, shoebox-sized time capsule was removed Thursday from the head of a lion statue where it had long sat, hidden in plain sight, atop one of Boston's most famous landmarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the copper box was carefully pried open, it revealed at least one mystery: a red, hardcover book with no visible title or markings. The contents of the book — and the rest of the items in the box — will remain a mystery for a bit longer, as they were deemed too fragile to remove immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time capsule's presence at the Old State House had only recently been confirmed. The Bostonian Society, which oversees the building, had expected it to contain a potpourri of photographs and newspaper clippings from the period, along with a missive to future generations penned by a group of Boston journalists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm absolutely delighted by the conditions inside the box,\" said Brian LeMay, the society's president, noting little sign of mold or water damage. Historians had feared the contents could have been destroyed had the box been improperly sealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time capsule was placed inside the lion's head in 1901 and then forgotten, even as waves of tourists visited the building that once served as a fulcrum of British rule in the northern colonies and later as the first seat of Massachusetts state government.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1770, British soldiers opened fire on a crowd of protesters outside the building, killing five in what came to be known as the Boston Massacre.\n",
      "\n",
      "The society first learned of the possible existence of the time capsule three years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on renovations to the building and was believed to have placed the box in the lion's head and catalogued its contents. A 1901 article from The Boston Globe surfaced later, alluding to contents of a copper box \"which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The box was removed Thursday by Robert Shure, president of Skylight Studios in suburban Woburn, where the copper and gold-leaf lion statue had been brought for refurbishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shure placed the box on a table and used a drill and other tools to cut it open. The bright red book was the first object seen inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth Roscio, archivist for the Bostonian Society, speculated that the book could be a Rogers' family history, but LeMay was less certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm as anxious as anyone in this room to just grab it and look inside,\" he said. But Roscio explained that to avoid possible damage, the contents must be removed and examined in a temperature-controlled setting. They could go on public display at the Old State House later this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In accepting the gift from the past, the society has also decided to leave one for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new time capsule, made of titanium, will be inserted back into the head of the lion. Suggestions on what to include are still being solicited, LeMay said, but one item will be a medal from the 2013 Boston Marathon, a symbol to future generations of the city's resiliency in the face of tragedy.\n",

      "\n",
      "FALSE\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: [Collected via email, December 2014]\n",
      "\n",
      "Deandre Joshua, 20 was murdered after testifying to a grand jury in the ferguson, MO case. Supposedly he was found not far from where Brown's body was & he was covered in lighter fluid. It was a post I saw on FB & just wondered if it was true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Origins: Shortly after a 20-year-old man named Deandre Joshua was killed in Ferguson, Missouri, on 24 November 2014, rumors started circulating around the Internet connecting the young man's murder to the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the controversial shooting death of Michael Brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The details of Joshua's death are gruesome. According to the Washington Post, Deandre was shot once in the head and then burned inside his car. The incident occurred on the same night protesters took to the streets of Ferguson to protest the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson. These circumstances, coupled with the fact that Joshua was a friend of Dorian Johnson, who was with Mike Brown on the night of his death, led many to believe Joshua's murder was in some way connected to Wilson's non-indictment:\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Deandre Joshua. This 20 year old man testified in the Grand Jury case against Darren Wilson. He was shot and killed on Tuesday. His body was found, with lighter fluid all over it, not far from where Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown. Why are broken windows on the front page of our news, and not his face?\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is no documentation Deandre Joshua testified before the grand jury. According to the Boston Globe , names of the witnesses were kept secret, and anyone who disclosed that information would face a misdemeanor charge. Additionally, Joshua's family and friends told the New York Times he was nowhere near the scene when Mike Brown was shot and killed, and prosecutors confirmed he was not a grand jury witness:\n",
      "\n",
      "According to family members, friends and law-enforcement officials, however, Joshua was nowhere near Canfield Drive when Brown was killed during a confrontation with Wilson on Aug. 9 and couldn't have witnessed the shooting. And McCulloch's office, which remained tight-lipped about the Wilson investigation, confirmed that Joshua didn't offer testimony during the proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was not a witness,\" said Ed Magee, a spokesman for the county prosecutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deandre Joshua did not witness the shooting of Michael Brown, nor did he testify before the grand jury. The only connection that Joshua had to the case was that he was a childhood friend of Dorian Johnson (who did witness the shooting):\n",
      "\n",
      "As of 2 December 2014, Deandre Joshua's death is still under investigation by police. It is unclear who killed Joshua or why they did so, but it is clear is Joshua's death was not retaliation for grand jury testimony in the Brown case.\"\n",

Per Harig, Olsen claimed on 730AM The Game in Lansing, Michigan, that Woods had been suspended for a month due to the use of PEDs and that an exempt player he didn't name had revealed the information. He also claimed that Woods used a \"cheater ball.\"\n",

Alas, the wrapper circulating online isn’t real, even though some people kind of want it to be.\\nThe image doesn’t look very authentic, but a pumpkin spice condom is just plausible enough that people kept sharing the image. At first, Durex kept speculation alive by not commenting on the matter. Pumpkin spice is hot in the United States, sure, but could the mania support a limited-time holiday-themed prophylactic? Durex does have a selection of fruit-flavored condoms, but no holiday-themed offerings. Should they?\\nThe company cleared things up this afternoon with a tweet:\\n\\nThey’ve THOUGHT about it?
